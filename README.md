## Orchid integration for DNA sequences

The Orchid-HyenaDNA model can be found in Orchid_and_HyenaDNA.ipynb. This notebook also contains:
* Training and testing for the 3 models on GenomicBenchmarks' human_enhancers_cohn dataset.
* Runtime evaluation of the 3 models on a single data point of sequence length 1024 on cpu.

Note: This notebook was constructed using [HyenaDNA's colab notebook](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-06-29-hyena-dna) example as the starting point.
